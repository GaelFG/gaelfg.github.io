<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<p><em>What input peripherals are supported ?</em></p>

<p>Wardens of the Amber Cage is designed to be played in virtual reality with a gamepad. Default setup works with xbox360 gamepad. <!--- Il est possible de mapper n'importe quel pad. ---> You aim with your head orientation. You will need some time to aim correctly if you have no prior experience.</p>

<p>If you play on a flat screen you can either use a mouse and a keyboard or a gamepad.</p>

<p>You can also use the strandard peripherals of the two supported Virtual Reality Head Mounted Diplays. In that case you must aim with the controller.
Using these controller is also possible while playing seated but take care of your surroundings and move the chair away from your screen, desk and any object you might collide with while playing.</p>

<p><em>How easily introduce a newbie for a short game session ?</em></p>

<p>You can read the <a href="http://www.gembasher.com/guide/" target="_blank">beginner guide</a>.</p>

<p><em>Which Virtual Reality Head Mounted Displays are compatible with Wardens of the Amber Cage ?</em></p>

<p>The HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift are compatible with the game. Currently phone based (like the Samsung Gear VR) Head Mounted Displays and the Playstation VR are not supported.</p>

<p><em>Can I play Wardens of the Amber Cage without Virtual Reality Head Mounted Display ?</em></p>

<p>Yes, even if the game was designed to be played in virtual reality, you can play on a standard flat screen.</p>

<h2 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h2>

<p><em>What is the ideal party size to play Wardens of the Amber Cage ?</em></p>

<p>Wardens of the Amber Cage is designed and balanced around the assumption most party will be 2-3 players based. Playing in solo is possible but easier and less interesting since a lot of the fun is about coordination and team communication.</p>

<p><em>Can we be two players using the same computer ?</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s currently not possible. We will study the possibility to allow a simultanous play, a player using the Virtual Reality Head Mounted Display while the other play on screen with  a keyboard and a mouse. In the meanwhile we hope the low technical requierement for the flat screen game allow you to use laptops for a lan play.</p>

<p><em>How launch a multiplayer game ?</em></p>

<p>The steps are given in the <a href="http://www.gembasher.com/guide/#multiplayer" target="_blank">multiplayer part</a> of the <a href="http://www.gembasher.com/guide/" target="_blank">beginner guide</a>.</p>

<p><em>Is there a matchmaking system ?</em></p>

<p>Yes. But we want you to play with your friends as much as possible by making them download the game. Even when we will switch to the selling phase, there will be a dedicated lightweight free client allowing them to play with you without buying the game.</p>

<p><em>How communicate with my party while playing ?</em></p>

<p>Wardens of the Amber Cage currently don&rsquo;t have an integrated chat system. If you don&rsquo;t already have a chosen vocal chat platform, you can try <a href="https://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> which is free.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-reality">Virtual Reality</h2>

<p><em>Can I play in Roomscale ?</em></p>

<p>Yes, you can play standing. A rotation system in the controllers/gamepad allow to use standing mode of the Oculus Rift even with only 180° tracking.</p>

<p><em>Can I play standing with Oculus Rift if I don&rsquo;t own the third camera required for full Roomscale (360) tracking) ?</em></p>

<p>Yes, you can play Wardens of the Amber Cage standing or seated even with a 180° tracking. Buttons on your gamepad or controllers allows customizable step rotations.</p>

<p><em>Can I stay play Wardens of the Amber Cage seated in Virtual Reality ?</em></p>

<p>Yes. If you start played seated, your virtual height will be ajusted accordingly. Physical ground movements are optional. Wardens of the Amber Cage was designed to be played seated with a gamepad, but Head Mounted Display controllers are usable even seated. No violent gesture is required but take care about having enough room around you to avoid hitting something ou someone.</p>

<p><em>Does Wardens of the Amber Cage allow traditional First-Person Shooter movements in Virtual Reality ?</em></p>

<p>Yes, it is the default movement system on both flat screen and Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Device play.</p>

<p><em>Does Wardens of the Amber Cage allow teleport-based movements ?</em></p>

<p>Currently no. But a Virtual Reality teleport only moveset should be ready for release.<!-- You need to manually enable by opening the options menu and activate 'Step Movements'.--></p>

<p><em>May Wardens of the Amber Cage cause Virtual Reality (VR) sickness ?</em></p>

<p>Yes. Especially without prior experience, the movements of the game can cause serious nausea.
If you are showing the game to someone never having tried Virtual Reality before know that first session can quickly became awfull. Best way to accommodate seems to make longer and longer session (first one could be as short as 1 or 2 minutes). Stop playing as soon as you feel sick. Take a break, don&rsquo;t play again until you feel better, and after some session you will probably get used to it and stop feeling dizzy.</p>

<p>Tireness, flu or being sick in general make the game unplayable (it&rsquo;s true for VR gaming in general).</p>

<p>In any case, you should try the game before buying it.</p>

<p><em>I launch Wardens of the Amber Cage with my Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Display on but nothing shows up. What is the problem ?</em></p>

<p>Wardens of the Amber Cage first launch in flat screen display mode. You have to open the option menu and activate the virtual reality mode by following the step described in the <a href="http://www.gembasher.com/guide/#first-use" target="_blank">dedicated part</a> of the <a href="http://www.gembasher.com/guide/" target="_blank">beginner guide</a>.</p>
