<h2 id="first-use">First Use</h2>

<p>We advise you to read theses instructions before you first playing session as the game currently lack in-game tutorial :</p>

<p>Launch the game.</p>

<p><em>Virtual Reality Only Setup :</em></p>

<p>If you want to play with a Virtual Reality headset, you must setup the game options.
Check the field &lsquo;Play in VR Mode&rsquo; to switch on Virtual Reality display mode. This option will stay activated on following launchs.</p>

<p>If you are a seasonned Virtual Reality player, you should not have problems with the default movement system.VR Sickness is a complicated topic. on our local tests with about 30 persons, first minutes are awfull and discomfort quickly decrease with time and disappear for everyone after 3-4 session of 10-20 minutes each. Otherwise a full teleport mode is also planned and should be available at release.</p>

<p>Default setup for step rotations is a 45° angle. Step rotation can be really disorienting at first use and you will need some time to find them intuitive.
You can either increase or decrease the angle in the game options.</p>

<p><em>End of Virtual Reality Only Setup</em></p>

<p>Select the &lsquo;Play&rsquo; button to start a game.</p>

<p>If you are playing a multiplayer game, we advise you to exit the starting room and wait for eachother on the entreance hall before entering the dungeon door.</p>

<p>Starting from this point, your goal is to follow the light while avoid being kill by monsters. Be carefull, once they spot you, they will relentlessly chase you until your death ! We advise you to kill them when you meet then and so avoid being outnumbered.</p>

<p>You should end up in a suspiciously wide and calm room with a locked door. Once every player enter the central platform, the boss fight will begin. Once he is dead, a way out will open and you will access to a temporary ending.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have beated the demonstration version :).</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>

<p><em>Note : Game will launch with 4 different skillsets, each having it&rsquo;s particularity and gameplay.</em></p>

<p>During the preview phase, you play with a more simple and versatile skillset. It has 4 skills :</p>

<p><strong>Main attack :</strong></p>

<p>Keeping the  Main Attack button down allow continious firing and damage hitten targeted hostiles. The main attack dont consume your magical energy but do slow you down. <strong>Note : There is no advantage of timing the spamming of the attack button over just keeping it put down if you plan to fire multiple fireballs.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Secondary attack (Slowing):</strong></p>

<p>This skill slow down your target movements. Maintain the button down to charge your spell and release it to launch the missile. A too early release waste the spell.</p>

<p><strong>Teleportation :</strong></p>

<p>This spell instantly teleport you 12 meters in your looking direction. It allows to avoid a lot of hazards and goed throught others players and most monsters. Beware, physical and magical walls block teleportation.</p>

<p><strong>Stunning Attack :</strong></p>

<p>Using this spell require you to be realy close of your target(s). After 1.5 seconds of channeling, an explosion centred around you stun and damage near ennemies. The stunning effect cut any spell channeling of affected monters.</p>

<p><strong>Tactical advices (countain spoilers) :</strong></p>

<p>Character controls are simples. However, step rotations, motion and the teleport spell can be really disorienting when first encountered in Virtual Reality. Basically, the goal of the game is to stay at middle range of the monster to avoid getting hit while firing spells on them.</p>

<p>While playing in group, individual player damage outputs are low. Magical energy being equaly used to escape hazards, slow and interrupts enemies, wasting it by stacking multiple crowd control spells on the same ennemy can cost your life. Target selection coordination is mandatory both for crow control and avoid being overwhelmed.</p>

<p>You should always keep enough energy to avoid a fatal attack with a teleport spell.</p>

<p>Currently only necromancers (floatings skeletons in dresses) really need being stunned to avoid letting them cast their reinforcement summonning spell.</p>

<p>Slows are a must have on some ennemies and a comfort for most of them but cost a lot of energy.</p>

<p>You can and are strongly advised to play Wardens of the Amber Cage in multiplayer mode. You then need a player to host the session. 2 players then can join the game. In order to balance the game for each party size, spell costs and damage output change with the number of players in the party.</p>

<p><strong>Hosting a new game :</strong></p>

<!-- A player wanting to host a session must be accessible thought a TCP port. Default value is 7777 but you can manualy choose another.
In order to be accessible, he might need to open this port on his computer. If his computer is behind a router (Wich is probableif you have an Internet Access Provider ) you may need to setup it. This setup must create a Network Address Translation of the chosen port on his public IP adress to the chosen port on the hosting computer.

*Note : This setup being heavily dependent of the combinaison of hardware and software you're using (Operating Systems, intermediate routers, antivirus and firewalls), we are forced to let you to look for it by yourselve.*

Once accessible, he only have to choose the 'New Game' option on the entry menu. No messages currently nofifie you about other players connections.
-->

<p>You must be logged on Gamejolt in order to play in multiplayer. On the title screen, hit the multiplayer button and then hit &lsquo;Host New Game&rsquo;.</p>

<p>You should wait in the entrance hall next to your spawning zone while regrouping.</p>

<p><strong>Joining an Existing Game :</strong></p>

<!-- you must type the IP adress of the host, eventually folowed by ":portnumber" if you use a custom port number, in the 'Server Adress' field next to the 'Join Game' button.

You can get your current public I.P. Adress by a lot of means. A simple exemple is to use [IP Chicken](https://www.ipchicken.com/).

Then you can select the 'Join Game' button and if the connexion is successfull, the game session begin. 

In case of connexion failure, you will be back on the entry menu avec a visual effect. 

Check the host have launched the game session. 

Check you have the good I.P. V4 address (Internet Service Provider can change it from time to time).

Check his TCP port is open

Check an antivirus/firewall is not denying the connexion.

*Note : Connexion will fail if the host is visible on the network but have not launched the game session yet.*
